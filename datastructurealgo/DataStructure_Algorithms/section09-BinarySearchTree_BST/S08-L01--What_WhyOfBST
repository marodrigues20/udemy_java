Binary Search Tree (BST)

What is Binary Search Tree?
Basically Binary Search Tree is a Binary Tree.

- Binary Search Tree (BST) is a Binary Tree in which all the nodes follows the
the bellow-mentioned properties:
  - The left sub-tree of a node has a key less than or equal to its parent node's key.
  - The right sub-tree of a node has a key greater than to its parent node's key.

If you want to improve efficiency of Linked List than Binary Search Tree comes
into picture because in terms of Space Efficiency Linked List is good but for
the rest of operations can be improved by Tree reducing time complexity
from O(n) to O(log n).
