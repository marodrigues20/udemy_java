When to use / Avoid Recursion?

When to use:
  - When we can easy breakdown a problem into similar subproblem##
  - When we are ok with extra overhead (both time and space) that comes with it.
  - When we need a quick working solution instead of efficient one.


When not to use:
  if the response to any of the above statements is NO, we should not go with
  recursion.
