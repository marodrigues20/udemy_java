What is 'Recursion'?

Properties of Recursion:
  - Same operation is performed multiple times with different inputs.
  - In every step we try to make the problem  smaller.
  - We mandatorily need to have a base condition, which tells system when to
  stop the recursion.


Example from Computing World: Let's say we want to search for value '4' in bellow
Tree.

SL01.1-L01-Tree.PNG --> Open this for you understand.

search (root, valueToSearch)
if (root equals null) return null
else if (root.value equals valueToSearch) return root
else if (valueToSearch < root.value) search(root.left, valueToSearch)
else search (root.right, valueToSearch)
