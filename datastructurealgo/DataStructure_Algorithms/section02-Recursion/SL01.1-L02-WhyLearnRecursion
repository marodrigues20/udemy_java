Why should we learn 'Recursion2'

- Because it makes the code easy to write (compared to 'iterative') whenever a
given problem can be broken down into similar sub-problem.

- Because it is heavily used in Data Structures  like Tree, Graphs, etc.

- It is heavily used in techniques like "Divide and Conquer", "Greedy", "Dynamic
Programming".





Note: * Iterative - Loop

Note: Similar sub-problem are in subsequent video.
