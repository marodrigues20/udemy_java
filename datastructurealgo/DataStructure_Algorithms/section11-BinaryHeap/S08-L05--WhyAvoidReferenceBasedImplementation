It's very advised implement Binary Heap using Array. Because when you need to
extract/delete one node you do in O(log n) time. When you delete you have to get
the last element and add at the position that you want to delete. In this case,
you get the last element get the last cell in the array in O(1) time. But
when you do this using LinkedList you have to traverse the LinkedList and you
gonna expend O(n) time. You spend more time.

For this reason, use array to implement Binary Heap.
