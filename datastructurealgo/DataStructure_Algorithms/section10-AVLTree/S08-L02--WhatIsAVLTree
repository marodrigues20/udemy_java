What is AVL Tree?

- An AVL tree is a balanced 'Binary Search Tree' where the height of immediate
subtrees of any node differs by at most one (also called balance factor)

Binary Search Tree
  - Left side is smaller the nodes than the right side

- If at any time heights differs by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore
this property (called rotation)
- When you don't have a AVL Tree in your tree you have to apply rotation.

- Empty heights always considered-1
Note: S08-L02--WhatIsAVLTree_img_2.PNG
- The height of subtree is 1
- How the right side (node 70) doesn't have child we consider the height -1.
- Height -1 will be explained in delete node.
