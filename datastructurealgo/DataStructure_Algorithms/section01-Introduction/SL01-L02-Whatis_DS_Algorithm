What is Algorithm ?

Algorithm: Is a set of rules to be followed to solve a problem.

Example: Let's say we want to prepare some home made salads for Dinner.

1) We have a basket all fruits and vegetables mixed (disorganized).
2) We use Data Structure to organize the vegetables and fruits in the basket.
3) We clean all fruits and vegetables.
4) We cut all of them
5) We have to do the trace part.
6) Finally we are ready for all dinner.

Steps 3, 4, 5 we set of rules to solve the problem.
