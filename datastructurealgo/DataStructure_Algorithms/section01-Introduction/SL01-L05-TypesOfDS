Types of Data Structure


Data Structure can be divided into two categories that is primitive data structure.

Primitive Data Structure which are given by even programming Language. If you are working in Java these
are data structures which are already defined by Java Language.
For others program languages as well. (C language)

Physical DS: They are implemented standalone and they are physically presented in the RAM.

Logical DS: They are logical in nature and they are dependent on the physical data structure
for their implementation. Let's talk about Stack. It has its own concept to push and pop. But
when it comes to implementation it can either be implemented in Array or Linked List. There isn't
third option.

All logical DS has your own concept and their own implementation. But when they need to be implemented
they need to choose one Physical DS (Array or Linked List).

We have many different of DS because depending on the problem we have to make the best choice of
feature Data Structure.
For example:
Work with Parent relation Tree is the best solution.
Computing a distance from one city to another graph looks perfectly.
If you want to implement queue, Queue Data Structure is perfect.
