Why so many types of Linked List?

Single Linked List
  - Is most basic form of linked list which give the flexibility to add/romove
  nodes at runtime.

Circular Single Linked List
  - When we want to loop through the list indefinitely until the list exists.
  - Example: Multiplayer board game. If we are tracking player's turn in Linked
  List.


Double Linked List:
  - When we want to move in both direction depending on requirement.
  - Example: Music player which has next and previous buttons.


Circular Double Linked List:
  - When we want to loop through the list indefinitely until the list exists. We
  also want to move both foreword and backward.
