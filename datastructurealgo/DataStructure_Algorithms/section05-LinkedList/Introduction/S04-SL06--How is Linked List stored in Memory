How is an Array represented in Memory?

Let's remember how array is allocated in RAM memory.

1D Array:
  - Arr[10] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};

Arrays is always stored in continuous memory location.
We specify how many continuous memory location should be allocated.
Arrays can access any cell directly. Linked List not.

How is Linked List represented in Memory?

We can add how many nodes we want because we did not specify how many continuous
memory location should be allocated for one linked list.
