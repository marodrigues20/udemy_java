-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Single linked List: In a singly linked list each node in the list stores the
data of the node and a reference to the next node in the list. It does not
store any reference to the previous node.


Circular Single Linked List: In the case of a circular doubly linked list. the
only change that occurs is that the end of the given list is linked back to
the front.

Double Linked List: In double linked list each node contains two references,
that references to the previous and next node.

Circular Double Linked List: In the case of a circular doubly linked list the
only change that occurs is that the end of the given list is linked back
to the front of the list and vice versa.
