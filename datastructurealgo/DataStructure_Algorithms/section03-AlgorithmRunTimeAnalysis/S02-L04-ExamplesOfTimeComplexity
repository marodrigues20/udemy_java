Examples of 'Algorithm run time complexities'

Time Complexity |   Name              | Example
O(1)            | Constant            | Adding and element at from of linked list
O(log n)        | Logarithmic         | Finding an element in sorted array
O(n)            | Linear              | Finding an element in unsorted array.
O(n logn)       | Linear Logarithmic  | Merge Sort
O(n^2)          | Quadratic           | Sortest path between 2 nodes in a graph
O(n^3)          | Cubic               | Matrix Multiplication
O(2^n)          | Exponential         | Tower of Hanoi Problem


The table above show the complexity and time consume.
