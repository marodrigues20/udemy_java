What & Why of 'Algorithm Run Time Analysis'

What is 'Algo Run Time Analysis'?
- It is a study of a given algorithm's running time, by identifying its behavior
as the input size for the algorithm increases. In a layman's language we can
say, 'how much time will the given algorithm will take to run'.

Why should we learn this?
- To measure 'efficiency' of a given algorithm.
- If we don't learn this topic, this is our program would look like.
