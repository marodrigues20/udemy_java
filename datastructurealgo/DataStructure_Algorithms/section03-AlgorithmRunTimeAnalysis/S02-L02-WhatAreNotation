Notations for 'Algo Run Time Analysis'


-How much does this car runs on 1 litre of petrol?
  - In City traffic? 10km/h
  - On highway? 20km/h
  - Mixed environment? 15km/h

Depends on the environment the car can consume more or less.

- There are 3 notations for 'Run Time Analysis'
    - Omega
      - This notation gives the tighter lower bound of given algorithm.
      - In a layman's language we can say that for any given input, running Time
      of a given algorithm will not be 'less than' given time.

    - Big-o(O)
      - This Notation gives the tighter upper bound of a given algorithm.
      - In a layman's language we can say that for any given input, running
      time of a given algorithm will not be 'more than' given time.

    - Theta(0):
      - This Notation decides whether upper bound and lower bound of a given
      algorithm are same or not.
      - In a layman's language we can say that for any given input, running
      time of a given algorithm will 'on an average' be equal to given time.
