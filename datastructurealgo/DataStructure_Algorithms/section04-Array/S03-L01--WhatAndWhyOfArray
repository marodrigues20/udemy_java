What is an Array?

- Observations from above Picture:
  - All the compartments are contiguous.
  - Each compartment can be identified uniquely.
  - Size of the box is fixed and cannot (as they come from standard manufactures)


Properties of Array:

- Array can store data of specified data type.
- It has contiguous memory location.
- Every 'cell' of an Array has an unique 'Index'.
- 'Index' starts with 0.
- 'Size of Array' needs to be specified mandatorily and can not be modified.

Definition of Array:
- Array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each
identified by array index. An array is stored such that the position of each
element can be computed from its index cell by a mathematical formula.

Why do we need an Array?

Problem Statement: We want to store 1 million similar data types in memory.

Solution#1:
  - We declare 1 million Primitive Data Structure like Integer, Float, Character,
  Boolean.
  - Problem: How will we maintain such a huge list of variables?


Solution#2:
  - We declare an array of size 1 million.
  - Advanced: We just need to reference the cell number of the array and we can
  access that cell.
