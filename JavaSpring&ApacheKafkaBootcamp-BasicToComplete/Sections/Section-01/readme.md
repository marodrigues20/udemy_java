### Difference Source Code 

- If at some points, you see minor difference between source code in lecture video and source
  files, it is normal.
- It might happened because I update either the video or source code file.
- In such case, I'll make sure the difference is minor and not breaking the application.
- In such case, you can still continue to use sample code with course.
