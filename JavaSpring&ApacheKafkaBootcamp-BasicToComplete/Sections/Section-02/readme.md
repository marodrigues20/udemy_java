# Section 2 - Spring Boot Version

- Spring Boot Version In This Course Important!
- This course uses Spring Boot version 2.x.
- On late November 2022, Spring Boot 3.0.0 released. It takes time for updating the course to Spring boot 3.0.0, but I will do my best.
- In the meantime, you have several options:
    - works with latest version of Spring boot 2.x, and the course should full compatible
    - works with Spring boot 3.x. Most of the courses should works, but some parts might need adjustment.
