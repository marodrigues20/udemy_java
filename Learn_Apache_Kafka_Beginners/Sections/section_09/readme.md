## Kafka Project setup

    - You should have download and installed intellij Community IDEA
    - Make sure Java 11 JDK is installed (Amazon Correto 11)

Maven vs Gradle?
    - In this course, we will use Grandle (easier to write, less errors)
    - Either will work for your Apache Kafka Java project
