# Section 4: Kafka Theory

## 7. Topics, Partitions and Offsets

### Topics

- Topics: a particular stream of data

- Like a table in a database (without all the constraints)
- You can have as many topics as you want
- A topic is identified by its name
- Any kind of message format
- The sequence of messages is called a data stream. (For this reason Kafka is called a data stream )
- You cannot query topics, instead, use Kafka Producers to send data and kafka Consumers to read the data



### Partitions and offsets

- Topics are split in partitions ( example: 100 partitions )
    - Each topic can have many partitions. 
    - Messages in each partition will be ordered.
    - Each message within a partition gets an incremental id, called offset
    - Each partition has different offset
    - Kafka topics are immutable. Once a message is written into the partition it cannot be changed. It cannot be deleted nor updated.

### Topics, partitions and offsets - important notes

    - Once the data is written to a partition, it cannot be changed (immutability)
    - Data is kept only for a limited time (default is one week - configurable)
    - Offset only have a meaning for a specific partition.
        - E.g: offset 3 in partition 0 doesn't represent the same data as offset 3 in partition 1
        - Offset are not re-used even if previous messages have been deleted
    - Order is guaranteed only within a partition (not across partitions)
    - Data is assigned randomly to a partition unless a key is provided (more on this later)

 
## 8. Producers and Message Keys

### Producers

    - Producers write data to topics (which are made of partitions)
    - Producers know to which partition to write to (and which Kafka broker has it)

### Producers: Messages keys

    - Producers can choose to send a key with the message (string, number, binary, etc.)
    - if key=null, data is sent round robin (partition 0, then 1, then 2...)
    - if key!=null, then all messages for that key will always go to the same partitions (hashing)
    - A key are typically sent if you need message ordering for a specific field ( ex: truck_id )


### Kafka Message Autonomy

i.e: Kafka_Msg_Autonomy.png

### Kafka Message Serializer

    - Kafka only accepts bytes as an input from producers and sends bytes out as an output to consumers
    - Message Serialization means transforming objects / data into bytes
    - They are used on the value and the key
    - Common Serializers 
        - String (incl. JSON)
        - Int, Float
        - Avro
        - Protobuf

### For the curious: Kafka Message Key Hashing

    - A Kafka partitioner is a code logic that takes a record and determines to which partition to send it into.
    - Key Hashing is the process of determining the mapping of a key to a partition.
    - In the default Kafka partitioner, the keys are hashed using the murmur2 algorithm, wich the formula below for the curious:

    targetParitition = Math.abs(Utils.murmur2(keyBytes)) % (numPartition - 1)


### Consumers

    - Consumers read data from a topic (identity by name) - pull model
    - Consumers automatically know which broker to read from 
    - In case of broker failures, consumers know how to recover
    - Data is read in order from low to high offset within each partitions


### Consumer Deserializer

    - Deserialize indicates how to transform bytes into objects / data
    - They are used on the value and the key of the message
    - Common Deserializers
        - String (incl. JSON)
        - Int, Float
        - Avro
        - Protobuf
    - The serialization / deserialization type must not change during a topic lifecycle ( Create a new topic instead )


### Consumer Group

    - All the consumers in an application read data as a consumer groups
    - Each consumer within a group reads from exclusive partitions


###Â Consumer Group - What if too many consumers

    - If you have more consumers than partitions, some consumers will be inactive 

### Multiple Consumers on one topic

    - In Apache Kafka it is acceptable to have multiple consumer groups on the same topic.
    - To create distinct consumer groups, use the consumer property group.id

### Consumer Offset

    - Kafka stores the offsets at which a consumer group has been reading.
    - The offsets commited are in Kafka topic named __consumer_offsets
    - When a consumer in a group has processed data received from kafka, it should be periodically commiting the offsets (the Kafka broke will write to __consumer_offsets, not the group.
    - If a consumer dies, it will be able to read back from where it left off thanks to the committed consumer offsets.


### Delivery semantics for consumers

    - By default, Java Consumers will automatically commit offsets (at least once)
    - There are 3 delivery semantics. If you choose to commit manually:
    - At least once (usually preffered)
        - Offsets are commited after the message is processed
        - If the process goes wrong, the message will be read again
        - This can result in duplicate processing of messages. Make sure your processing is idempotent. (i.e: processing again the messages won't impact your systems)

    - At most one
        - Offsets are committed as soon as messages are received
        - If the processing goes wrong, some messages will be lost (They won't be read again)
    
    - Exactly once
        - For Kafka => Kafka workflows: use the Transaction API (easy with Kafka Stream API)
        - For Kafka => External System workflows: use an idempotent consumer
    

### Kafka Brokers

    - A Kafka cluster is composed of multiple brokers (servers)
    - Each broker is identified with its ID (integer)
    - Each broker contains certain topic partitions
    - After connecting to any broker (called a bootstrap broker), you will be connected to the entire cluster (Kafka clients have smart mechanism for that)
    - A good number to get started is 3 brokers, but some big clusters have over 100 brokers
    - In these examples we choose to number brokers starting at 100 (arbitrary)


### Brokers and Topics

    - Example of Topic-A with 3 partitions and Topic-B with 2 partitions
    - Note: data is distributed, and Broker 103 doesn't have any Topic B data

i.e: Broker_Topics.png

### Kafka Broker Discovery

    - Every Kafka broker is also called a "bootstrap server"
    - That means that you only need to connect to one broker, and the Kafka clients will know how to be connected to the entire cluster (smart clients)
    - Each broker knows about all brokers, topics and partitions (metadata)

i.e: Kafka_Broker_Discovery.png

### Topic Replication factor

    - Topics should have a replication factor > 1 (usually between 2 and 3)
    - This way if a broker is down, another broker can serve the data 
    - Example: Topic-A with 2 partitions and replication factor of 2

i.e: Topic_Replication_Factor.png


    - Example: we lose Broker 102
    - Result: Broke 101 and 103 can still serve the data


### Concept of Leader for a Partition

    - At any time only ONE broker can be a leader for a given partition
    - Producer can only send data to the broker that is leader of a partition
    - The other broker will replicate the data
    - Therefore, each partition has one leader and multiple ISR (in-sync replica)

    Note: The star on the diagram, represents the leader.

    i.e: Concept_Of_Leader_Partition.png


### Default producer & consumer behavior with leaders

    - Kafka Producers can only write to the leader broker for a partition
    - Kafka Consumers by default will read from the leader broker for a partition


i.e: Default_Producer.png


### Kafka Consumers Replica Fetching (Kafka v2.4+)

    - Since Kafka 2.4, it is possible to configure consumers to read from the closest replica
    - This may help improve latency, and also decrese network costs it if using the cloud.



### Producer Acknowledgements (acks)

    - Producer can choose to receive acknowledgment of data writes:
        - acks=0: Producer won't wait for acknowledgement (possible data loss)
        - acks=1: Producer will wait for leader acknowledgement (limited data loss)
        - acks=all: Leader + replicas acknowledgement (no data loss)

### Kafka Topic Durability

    - For a topic replication factor of 3, topic data durability can withstand 2 brokers loss.
    - As a rule, for a replication factor of N, you can permanently lose up to N-1 brokers and still recover your data.


### Zookeeper

    - Zookeeper manages brokers (keeps a list them)
    - Zookeeper helps in performancing leader election for partition
    - Zookeeper sends notification to Kafka in case of changes 
    (e.g. new topic, broker dies, broker comes up, delete topics, etc )
    - Kafka 2.x can't work without Zookeeper
    - Kafka 3.x can work without Zookeeper (KIP-500) - using Kafka Raft instead
    - Kafka 4.x will not have Zookeeper
    - Zookeeper by design operates with an odd number of servers (1, 3, 5, 7)
    - Zookeeper has a leader (writes) the rest of the servers are followers (reads)
    - (Zookeeper does NOT store consumer offsets with Kafka > v0.10)

    i.e. Zookeeper_Cluster.png


### Should you use Zookeeper?

    - With Kafka Brokers?
        - Yes, until Kafka 4.0 is out while waiting for Kafka without Zookeeper to be production-ready
    - With Kafka Clients?
        - Over time, the Kafka clients and CLI have been migrate to leverage the brokers as a connection endpoint instead of Zookeeper
        - Since Kafka 0.10, consumers store offset in Kafka and Zookeeper and must not connect to Zookeeper as it is deprecated.
        - Since Kafka 2.2, the Kafka-topics.sh CLI command references Kafka brokers and not Zookeeper for topic management (creation, deletion, etc ...) and the Zookeeper CLI argument is deprecated.
        - All the APIs commands that were previously leveraging Zookeeper are migrated to use Kafka instead, so that when clusters are migrated
        to be without Zookeeper, the change is invisable to clients.
        - Zookeeper is also less secure than Kafka, and therefore Zookeeper ports should only be opened to allow traffic from Kafka Brokers, 
        and not Kafka clients.
        - Therefore, to be a great modern-day Kafka developer, never ever use Zookeeper as a configuration in your Kafka clients, and other 
        programs that connect to Kafka.


### About Kafka KRaft

    - In 2020, the Apache Kafka project started to work to remove the Zookeeper dependency from it (KIP-500)
    - Zookeeper shows scaling issues when Kafka cluster have > 100,000 partitions
    - By removing Zookeeper, Apache Kafka can
        - Scale to millions of partitions, and becomes easier to maintain and set-up 
        - Improve stability, makes it easier to monitor, support and administer
        - Single process to start with Kafka
        - Faster controller shutdown and recovery time
    - Kafka 3.X now implements the Raft protocol (KRaft) in order to replace Zookeeper
